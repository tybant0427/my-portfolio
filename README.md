Updated Portfolio Page 

For this homework assignment we were tasked with adding our first project along with 2 homework assignments to our project section of our portfolio page. 

We were also supposed to link our GitHub and LinkedIn profiles which I already had done the first time around working on my portfolio. You can see these linked icons at the bottom of my page. 

I am also in the process of completely revamping my portfolio page and that will be posted as soon as it feels finished and up to par.
